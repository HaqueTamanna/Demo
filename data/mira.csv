,,steps and the different methods and approaches used for implementing each step.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,3.1.,Pre-Processing Algorithms,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,that removes redundant features by transforming them from a spatial space onto a,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,lower-dimensional space.,,,"LDA reduces the dimensions in each dataset, retains the",,,,,,,,,,
,,"most important features, and achieves higher class separability [31].",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,(2),Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE): SMOTE is a statistical oversam-,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,pling technique to obtain a synthetically class-balanced dataset.,,,,,,,,,It provides a balanced,,,,

,vestigating regression analysis and classiﬁcation data.,,,,,,,,,,It also uses the classiﬁcation,,,,,,,
,for,two-group,classiﬁcation,,,problems.,SVM,are,nonparametric,,,,classiﬁers.,,,For,the,
,"training set, inputs and outputs are paired in SVM. Decision functions are attained",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,through the input–output pairs that classify the input variables into the new and test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3.3.3.,Deep Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Deep learning is a type of ML that enhances computers to gain for a fact and compre-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,hend the world as far as a hierarchy of ideas.,,,,,,,The hierarchy of ideas permits the computer,,,,,,
,to learn confounded ideas by building them out of more straightforward ones; a graph of,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,these hierarchies would be many layers deep.,,,,,,,In image processing and computer vision,,,,,,

,5,Future Research Possibilities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"We propose some possible future study directions in this part, based on the review of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,prior research in the preceding section.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,(1),A larger data sample is required:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,The majority,,of prior,,depression detection,,,research utilized a,,,,,small sample,,,size.,A
,,"small sample size is useful for building a prediction model, while a bigger sample size is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,important for constructing a more accurate model that works well throughout the popula-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,tion.,"When a large sample size is used to train a model, it allows for a greater diversity of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"depressed patients to be included, perhaps leading to models with real therapeutic value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"When a few studies use bigger datasets, the methods will most likely alter and show more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,developed approval metrics.,,,,"The k-fold cross-validation technique, in particular, may be",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,employed,with,higher,k-values,to,allow,,for,larger,test,sets,on,which,to,test,prediction,
,,models and increase generalizability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,(2),Learning method(s):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Various learning techniques give a better outcome in different situations; therefore,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,choosing the right one is crucial.,,,,Unlabeled data may sometimes help develop a prediction,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Electronics 2022, 11, 1111",,,,,,,,,,,,,17 of 20,,,
,model for a large sample size with little data.,,,,,,"As a result, the ﬁrst step is to determine if the",,,,,,,,,
,"incoming data are labeled, unlabeled, or a combination of labeled and unlabeled data.",,,,,,,,,,,,As a,,,
,"result, employing an unsupervised, supervised, or semi-supervised learning technique will",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,be determined.,,"The second phase is dependent on the learning method’s objective, which",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,must be addressed.,,,The last stage is to identify whether the input is linear or nonlinear;,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"linear data are helpful when the dataset is small to prevent overﬁtting, whereas nonlinear",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,data are important when the dataset is big.,,,,,,The last step is to choose a learning technique,,,,,,,,,
,to limit the options.,,,The technique for picking the best learning method is to assess various,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"factors such as complexity, ﬂexibility, computation time, optimization ability, and so on,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,and then choose the best one.,,,,,"If you have too many learning method choices, evaluate the",,,,,,,,,,
,"performance of each technique on the provided data; if you just have a few, simply change",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the default model to make it more appropriate for learning the given data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3),Clinical application:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Long-term,",,,creating,a,predictive,model,aims,to,ﬁnd,a,method,that,can,improve,
accuracy.,,,"However, such a scenario is unlikely to arise in the next few years, since SVM",,,,,,,,,,,,,
and,a,few,other,supervised,,learning,algorithms,are,presently,trustworthy,,and,seem,to,,
be,around,,in,this,area,of,research.,"Regardless,",after,a,sufﬁciently,strong,method,has,,
been,,thoroughly,,authorized,,via,preliminary,"considerations,",,showing,,its,"efﬁcacy,",and,,
,"determining whether it will beneﬁt patients or not, its progression to clinical preliminaries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,will be critical.,,Future clinical trials should ensure that machine learning methods efﬁciently,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,identify depressed individuals who are unlikely to respond to the current specialist under,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
investigation.,,,"Clinicians’ use of this information improves patient outcomes (for example,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,diminished inactivity among determination and reduction).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(4),Collaboration of research groups:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,With,,the,signiﬁcant,progress,among,different,"disciplines,",,collaboration,,with,other,,,
,"disciplines is crucial for ADE. For affective computing, relevant ﬁelds include psychology,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"physiology,",,,computer,,"science,","ML,",etc.,"Thus,",researchers,should,borrow,each,other’s,,,
,strengths to promote ADE’s advances.,,,,,,"For audio-based ADE, the deep models only repre-",,,,,,,,,
,sent the depression scale from audios.,,,,,,The deep models capture patterns only from facial,,,,,,,,,
,"expressions speciﬁc to video-based ADE. Notably, physiological signals also contain signiﬁ-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,cant information closely related to depression estimation.,,,,,,,,"Accordingly, different researchers",,,,,,,
,should study together to build multimodal-based DL approaches for clinical application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5),Availability of databases:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Because,,of,the,sensitivity,of,depression,"data,",it,is,difﬁcult,to,gain,various,data,for
,estimating the scale of depression.,,,,,"Hence,",the availability of data is a major issue.,,,,,,"First,",,,
,"as opposed to the facial expression recognition task, database availability is scarce up to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the present day.,,,"Given the literature review, one can note that the widely used depression",,,,,,,,,,,,
databases,,,are,"AVEC2013,",,"AVEC2014,",and,DAIC-WOZ.,,"Notably,",AVEC2014,is,a,subset,,
of,AVEC2013.,,"Second,",,there,is,no,multimodal,"(i.e.,","audio,","video,","text,",physiological,sig-,,
,nals) database to learn comprehensive depression representations for ADE. The existing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,databases consist of two or three modalities.,,,,,,Though the DAIC database comprises three,,,,,,,,,
,modalities (audiovisual,,,,"and text),",the organizer,,has not,,provided the,original videos of,,,,,
,"DAIC, leading to a certain inconvenience for ADE. Third, the limited size of the datasets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"limits the research in depression prediction, especially when using DL technologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,For,,
,"instance, AVEC2013 only contains 50 samples for training, development, and test set.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Ef-,,
fective,,methods,,to,augment,the,limited,amount,of,annotated,data,are,called,to,address,
,this bottleneck.,,,"Fourth, the criteria for data collection should be standardized.",,,,,,,,"At present,",,,,
